(* Assumes that the CSV text adheres to the convention:
   Records are delimited by LFs or CRLFs (but CRs are also allowed here).
   The last record in the text may or may not be followed by an LF or CRLF (or CR).
   Fields in the same record are separated by commas (unless specified differently by parameter).
   The last field in a record must not be followed by a comma.
   Trailing or leading spaces in unquoted fields are not ignored (unless so specified by parameter).
   Fields containing quoted text are quoted in their entirety, any space outside them being ignored.
   Fields enclosed in double-quotes are to be taken verbatim, except for any included double-quote pairs, which are to be translated as double-quote characters.
       
   No other variations are currently supported. *)
