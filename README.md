# batch-kimble-travel
Little app that can take values populated in a .csv files and use them to create a travel request in Kimble Salesforce
-- Open Kimble in Safari (assumes you are logged in)
-- How this works...
-- Use the csv template to enter the details of the travel you wish to request in Kimble
-- Do NOT muck around with the headings, and don't use any commas. Make sure you save it as a csv, NOT xlsx
-- Save that file (don't rename it) in the same folder that this app will live in.  It expects it to be co-located.
Not planning on making this particularly robust, so use with caution.  No intention to set these to auto-submit.
